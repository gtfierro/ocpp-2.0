# OCPP-2.0

The OCPP 2.0 spec is available for free at [Open Charge Alliance](https://www.openchargealliance.org/protocols/ocpp-20/)

This is a minimal implementation of the spec for a Charging Station, written in Go.
Eventually, this will interface with our XBOS driver for the Aerovironment charging station (found [here](https://github.com/SoftwareDefinedBuildings/bw2-contrib/tree/master/driver/aerovironment)).
